# interactive-revy


This project was hacked together in order to achive interactive votes to the revue of Abakusrevyen in 2020. Marionett was the first streamed revue of abakus, and here we did a poll during the break between first and second act. This website was ran inside OBS in order to distribute vote results to end users. While not knowing what power OBS could use, we did not use React in this project, however, later we have seen that OBS handles react totally fine. Therefore I really encourage you to use React in projects like this.
